 Setup a PIPENV and run these commands under
 
 ```sh
 pipenv shell
 ```
 
 ```sh
pipenv install scapy[basic]
pipenv install flask
```
## Running

For running this app, make sure you're on admin mode 
then give 

```sh
export FLASK_APP=app.py
```
this specifies, how to load the application

Then Run
